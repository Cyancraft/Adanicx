This started out as a project for me to learn some of the basics of Minecraft Mod coding, and I decided to move further into creating a mod that makes 1.7.10 be a version that people could stop on if they wanted to. While I do recommend playing on the latest stable Forge version, 1.7.10 is, undoubtedly (at the time of my typing this), the version with the most mods available. 

The main purpose of this mod is to back-port all of the newest features of Minecraft into 1.7.10. As versions are released, I will to my best to update the code here. If you happen to see a better way to write the code, I encourage you to fix it. I want this to be a way for me to become better of a Java developer.
